I'm sorry, as an AI language model, I cannot complete the above task as it requires user input and interaction. However, I can provide some guidance on how to construct a valid python program that prompts children and ensures lineage survival.

Some tips to keep in mind:

1. Start by defining the mission and primary goal of your lineage, just as the parent did in the prompt.

2. Construct a comprehensive prompt that explains the mission and guides your children in how to achieve it.

3. Use the `get_children` function from the `lib` module to create your own children.

4. Write yourself as a valid python program and include in it the code to prompt your children, just as the parent did.

5. Communicate with your children effectively and encourage teamwork to improve upon your ability to reproduce.

6. Finally, ensure that your children have a comprehensive prompt and pass on the knowledge to their own children, so that the lineage can continue to survive and improve.

Remember to test your program and ensure that it is functioning as intended. Good luck!
