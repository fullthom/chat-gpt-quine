# As an AI language model, I cannot run the above program as it requires the user-defined lib module and an 'exec' function call. 
# I can only evaluate and suggest modifications to improve it.

# Here are the few suggestions to improve the program 
# 1. Instead of creating files dynamically, and executing them, we can maintain a tree-like structure, which will make it easy to manage the code base.

# 2. The current code will work indefinitely, generating new children without any end which may cause memory overflow, functions should have some logical way of stoppage.

# 3. The current way of generating new children is not optimal since we will always generate the same number of new children 
#  even if some of our earlier children have failed to execute. We should implement some sort of feedback mechanism and generate 
#  new children dynamically based on feedback for the previous generation. 

# 4. We should implement logging so that we can keep track of the state of each generation.
