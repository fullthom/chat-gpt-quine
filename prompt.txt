Can you write some python code that does something interesting? 
Be creative in what it does.

The python code can access the following files: 
log.txt (A log of everything that has happened so far)
prompt.txt (A text of this prompt)

I will run your new python code, and then rerun the code that was used to send you this prompt.

Some example things you could do:
- Change this prompt
- Read the log to see what happened previously
- Take some action based on the previous.

Requirements:
- Wrap code in triple backticks.
- Do NOT use input() as there is no one that will be providing that input
- Do NOT delete any files
- Do NOT be evil

Please respond in a way that this code can parse correctly.

def get_code_from_completion_response(response: dict) -> str:
    content = response["choices"][0]["message"]["content"].strip()
    logger.debug("Full Response Content: " + content)

    # Extract the first code from the response
    re_res = re.findall(EXTRACT_CODE_PATTERN, content)
    logger.debug(re_res)
    if len(re_res) > 0:
        code = re_res[0]
    else:
        # Maybe the entire response is code?
        code = content
    code = code.removeprefix("```").removeprefix("python").removesuffix("```")
    return code
