Can you write some python code that does something interesting? 
Be creative in what it does.

The python code can access the following files: 
log.txt (A log of everything that has happened so far)
prompt.txt (A text of this prompt)


I will run your new python code, and then rerun the code that was used to send you this prompt.

Some example things you could do:
- Change this prompt
- Read the log to see what happened previously
- Take some action based on the previous.

Please respond in a way that this code can parse correctly:
```python
def get_code_from_completion_response(response: dict) -> str:
    content = response["choices"][0]["message"]["content"].strip()
    logger.debug("Full Response Content: " + content)

    # Extract the first code from the response
    code = ""
    for match in re.finditer(EXTRACT_CODE_PATTERN, content):
        code = match.group(1).strip()
        logger.debug("Extracted code: " + code)
        if code.startswith("python"):
            code = code[6:].strip()
        break

    if not code:
        logger.error("No code found in response")
        raise ValueError("No code found in response")

    return code
```


Do not:
- use input() as there is no one that will be providing that input
- delete any files
- be evil
