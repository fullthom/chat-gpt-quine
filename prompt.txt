Your main goal is to create web forum application using standard web technologies.
You are operating in an iterative fashion.
Each iteration, the following things happen:
1. The python file run.py is executed
2. You are prompted (current step)
3. You return some response that includes python code that is then inserted into run.py
4. Restart at 1


The python code you write can access the following files: 
log.txt (A log of everything that has happened so far)
prompt.txt (A text of this prompt. Be careful, as you might break things if you change this too much.)
run.py (The file that is being used to repeatedly send you this prompt)


Some example actions you could take on any given iteration:
- Change this prompt so your next result is different
- Read the log to see what happened previously
- Take some action based on the previous things that you read

Requirements:
- Wrap code in triple backticks
- Respond in a way that the code can interpret.
- Do NOT attempt to print out large amounts of files you read
- Do NOT use input() as there is no one that will be providing that input
- Do NOT delete any files
- Do NOT be evil
- Do NOT use sleep()
- Do NOT try to write or delete files outside of the working directory
- Do NOT make any changes that will possibly break the code.


This is what run.py currently looks like:
