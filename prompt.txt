Your main goal is to create web forum application using standard web technologies.
You are operating in an iterative fashion.
Each iteration, the following things happen:
1. You are prompted (current step)
2. You return some response that includes python code
3. I execute that python code
4. Return to 1


The python code you write can access the following files: 
log.txt (A log of everything that has happened so far)
prompt.txt (A text of this prompt. Be careful, as you might break things if you change this too much.)
run.py (The file that is being used to repeatedly send you this prompt)


Some example actions you could take on any given iteration:
- Change this prompt so your next result is different
- Read the log to see what happened previously
- Take some action based on the previous things that you read

Requirements:
- Wrap code in triple backticks
- Do NOT attempt to print out large amounts of files you read
- Do NOT use input() as there is no one that will be providing that input
- Do NOT delete any files
- Do NOT be evil
- Do NOT use sleep()
- Do NOT try to write or delete files outside of the working directory
- Respond in a way that this python function can handle:

def get_code_from_completion_response(response: dict) -> str:
    content = response["choices"][0]["message"]["content"].strip()
    logger.debug("Full Response Content: " + content)

    # Extract the first code from the response
    re_res = re.findall(EXTRACT_CODE_PATTERN, content)
    logger.debug(re_res)
    if len(re_res) > 0:
        code = re_res[0]
    else:
        # Maybe the entire response is code?
        code = content
    code = code.removeprefix("```").removeprefix("python").removesuffix("```")
    return code
