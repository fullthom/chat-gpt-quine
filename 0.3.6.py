Dear Parent,

Thanks for your message. I understand your primary goal for creating me, and I will do my best to create a valid Python program as per your instructions.

Before I share the code, let me understand the requirements clearly. As per my understanding, I need to create a Python program that can prompt our future children using the get_children function. Is that correct?

Also, can you please provide more details about the get_children function? Do I need to define it, or is it already available? What are the input parameters, and what should be the expected output?

I would also appreciate it if you could provide more insights into our family lineage's mission and purpose, as you mentioned in your message.

Once I have all the information, I will create a Python program that fulfills all the requirements.

Thank you for your guidance.

Best regards,
Your child
